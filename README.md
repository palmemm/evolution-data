This project was completed as the final project of the Codecademy Data and Programming Foundations for AI course.

Analysis of a Kaggle dataset containing information on humanoids during various stages of human evolution, compiled by an anthropology student at University of La Plata.

The goal of this analysis is to determine any trends between cranial capacity and distinguishing species characteristics, such as habitat or diet, and ultimately understand what features appear to be evolutionarily strengthening for a species regarding brain health and development. Though causal relationships will not be able to be identified from this dataset alone, some interesting correlations were uncovered.

Based on this data, it appears that cranial capacity of hominids generally increased over time. High cranial capacity was correlated with the species' use of tools/technology and their diets. Diet in turn was related to the species' habitats and the sizes of their incisor and canine teeth. Finally, species' height was directly correlated to their cranial capacity, with a correlation coefficient of 0.83.
